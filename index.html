  </h1>
  <p>
    I am a frontend engineer at Infosys, with 15+ years of experience and strong design background, who strongly
    advocate user experience and human-centred-design (HCD).
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my career in 2004, on a small company in my hometown and along the years I've been improving my
    development skills, always focusing my efforts on design, agile methodologies, working with the best performance
    possible and always encouraging team members to give their best.
  </p>
  <p>
    I seek to work alongside members of a team in which everyone has something to bring to the table, where open
    communication is encouraged and creativity is valued, helping them to navigate through complexity and find creative
    solutions to the user problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an entrepreneur, I have a particular interest in collaborating with startups and small businesses which means of
    software development and technical advice and help them take their products from the ideation to the achievement
    stage.
